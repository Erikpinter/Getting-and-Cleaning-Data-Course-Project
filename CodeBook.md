# Codebook for 'tidy2' dataset
_by Erik Pinter_

This Codebook describes the *'tidy2'* dataset, which is automatically generated by the *'run_analysis.R'* script, based on the *UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set*.

## Original data source

The original data was obtained from the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set on the 20th September 2016:

The original description of the dataset can be found here:

> *Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.*

> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

>The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 


## Variable Descriptions:
### Identifiers
* 'Subject': the ID of the subject who carried out the experiment (range 1-30)
* 'Activity': the activity label:
    * WALKING
    * WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    * WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    * SITTING
    * STANDING
    * LAYING

### Variable list 
The following table compares the variable names in the *tidy2 dataset* to the variable names in the *original dataset*, as well as the function that has been applied to the original data.

The original data has been clustered by:
* Subject and 
* Activity.
